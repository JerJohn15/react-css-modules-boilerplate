# Static React and CSS Modules

A React and CSS Modules project that generates static markup for tiny websites. All markup is generated in `/build` from `/src`.


### Getting started

Hop into the terminal:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`

BrowserSync will then open up a new tab where you can start to make new React components in `src/components`. These are bundles of markup and CSS that are designed to be imported into one of the templates (like an About page or a Homepage) in `src/templates`.
